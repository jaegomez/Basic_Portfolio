			<p>Hello all my name is Julio Gomez, I go by Jae. I'd like to start off by thanking you for stopping by my website. Before you proceed I would like to take some time to tell you a little about myself.</p>
			<p>I attended Florida SouthWestern State College in Naples, Florida where I got my AA with a focus on Business, I then had a change of heart and realized what I really enjoyed was Software and basically creating and building meaningful things. So I transferred to Lorenzo Walker Technical College, also located in Naples, Florida which is where I studied Computer Programming and now I am currently attending the UCF Coding Bootcamp in Orlando, Florida.</p>
			<p>Other hobbies of mine include playing/watching football, working out, cooking and traveling.</p>
